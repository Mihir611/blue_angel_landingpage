However, as it’s the new entry\-level model, there are a few things the new SportX trim misses out on compared to the top\-spec Luxury Line, which gets equipment like adaptive LED headlights, dynamic damper control, 16\-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, wireless charging, a 12\.3\-inch digital instrument cluster, a 10\.25\-inch infotainment system and larger 19\-inch wheels, to name a few\.

The X3 xDrive30i Luxury Line also has a 2\.0l 4cyl Turbocharged Engine which has 248HP with 350NM of torque\. It is supported by an Automatic \(Torque Converter\) \- 8 Gears, Manual Override & Paddle Shift, Sport Mode\.

The safety features of surround protection airbags, three\-point seat belts, ABS with EBD and BA, Dynamic Stability Control system, traction control system, crash sensors, and parking assist system are featured in this model\.

The BMW X3 xDrive20d Luxury Line: This car has been provided with a 2\.0L 4cyl Turbocharged Diesel engine which puts out 190Hp and 400NM of Torque\. This car gets an 8\-speed\-Automated \(Torque Converter\) Gearbox\. BMW X3 xDrive 20d Luxury Line is the base diesel variant in the [X3](https://www.zigwheels.com/newcars/BMW/X3) lineup and is priced at Rs\. 63\.70 Lakh \(ex\-showroom, Delhi\)\. This xDrive 20d Luxury Line variant comes with an engine putting out and of max power and max torque respectively\. BMW X3 xDrive 20d Luxury Line is available in transmission and offered in 4 colours: Sophisto Grey Brilliant Effect, Phytonic Blue, Mineral White and Black Sapphire\.

__Interior:__

Once seated in the X3, you’ll first appreciate the attractive overall design\. The feel\-good factor is exemplified by the tan leather that uses beige double\-seams that even run across the door pads and dash\. Likewise, the plush combo of piano black trim, granite\-finish inserts and the lavish use of brushed steel trim makes this cabin look extravagant\. 

For storage, this BMW gets twin cup\-holders on the lower centre console, a wireless charging tray that doubles up for other stowage purposes, a deep centre armrest, wide enclosures on all the door pads and an adequately sized glove\-box\. But, by far, the real delight is the Harman Kardon 16\-speaker music system that gets you totally hooked to your favourite numbers\.

You get an iDrive that’s Apple CarPlay compatible, and it also features a DVD drive along with access to a 20GB hard disc on board\. Not only does reading from the wide, high\-set display while driving feel effortless, the entire experience is richer due to the high resolution\. We also found the frame rates to be quick for swift toggling between screens\. 

As for the front seats, we would have preferred more thigh support\. However, there’s adequate back support along with just about the right amount of lateral support\. Knee\-room is good even for tall occupants and so is the headroom\. At the rear, the sloping roofline has resulted in the bench being placed lower to liberate adequate headroom\. As a result thigh support isn’t great\. 

Otherwise, the bench \(with recline adjust\) has just about the right contours, cushioning and knee room for a comfortable journey\. For two that is\. Only because the tall transmission tunnel and unfavourable centre cushioning isn’t exactly enticing for the middle passenger\. We also noticed that if it wasn’t for the panoramic sunroof, the higher window line could make it seem claustrophobic at the rear\.

Having said that, rear seat occupants have the convenience of a three\-zone air\-conditioner with vents, front seat\-back nets and a centre arm rest with cup\-holders\. Also, the 40:20:40 split folding seats enhance practicality by boosting the 550\-litre boot’s luggage carrying capacity\. We really liked the manner in which BMW neatly packaged the space\-saver spare wheel so that usable boot space isn’t compromised\.

__Good Things__

- 
	- Comfortable ride quality
	- Premium cabin
	- Refined motor and sorted ride

__Could be Better__

- 
	- No keyless entry
	- Heavy steering at low speeds
	- Rear seat lacks enough thigh support\.

__The Final Verdict:__

So, the BMW X3 is a go to SUV if you want a luxury and a spacious SUV and a much affordable price\.
