__The Final Verdict: __

The [Jaguar F\-Pace](https://www.motor1.com/jaguar/f-pace/) is one of those vehicles that I want to recommend to friends and family but never do\. It's a great looking crossover, and for the most part, it drives as well as the competitive [Mercedes](https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/) or [Audi](https://www.motor1.com/audi/)\. But since its debut, disappointing technology and a lacklustre interior have held it back from the kind of wide\-reaching appeal that alternatives like the [GLC\-Class](https://www.motor1.com/mercedes-benz/glc-class/) and [Q5](https://www.motor1.com/audi/q5/)\.
