The Maruti Fronx is powered by a 1\.2\-litre, four\-cylinder, NA petrol engine that generates an output of 89bhp and 113Nm of torque and a 1\.0\-litre, three\-cylinder, turbo\-petrol engine that produces 99bhp and 147Nm of torque\. Gearbox options include a five\-speed manual unit, an AMT unit, and a six\-speed torque converter automatic unit\.

- Now coming to the key features of this car, here are some of the features which make it a standout car despite its low performance figures\. 
- Side and curtain airbags
- All 3\-point seat belts
- Auto\-dimming inside rearview mirror

All in all, this car looks good in appearance and might be a go to car for some of the buyers and to be honest this is not such a bad car as people think it is\.
