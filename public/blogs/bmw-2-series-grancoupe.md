₹ 42\.3 Lakh

The 2 Series Gran Coupe comes with BMW's signature new kidney grille\. The raked\-back headlight units with double\-barrel LED detailing give it a unique look and also add on to the aggressive look\. The flowing roofline that flows into the fastback\-like rear and that's what gives it its unique look\. The L shaped LED taillights also give it a nice look\. Adding to the attraction are the pillarless windows\.

On safety the car packs in a lot\. 6 airbags, isofix child seat mounts, 3\-point seatbelts for all 5 occupants, ABS or anti\-lock brakes, stability and traction control that I already mentioned, run flat tyres and tyre pressure monitoring, and a lot more \- and these are all standard across both variants\.

The 220d comes with a 2\-litre diesel engine producing 190 horses and 400 Nm\. 0\-100 kmph is done in just 7\.5 seconds\. The 8\-speed step\-tronic transmission helps ease the way you drive\.

The 220i comes with a 2\-litre petrol engine producing 193 horses and 280Nm\. 0\-100 kmph is done in just 7\.1 seconds which is pretty decent for a front\-wheel\-drive car\. This also has an 8\-speed\-automatic gearbox\.

Making use of the same FAAR platform as the 1 Series, the 2 Series GC has a front\-wheel\-drive layout\. In terms of appearance, the Gran Coupe looks like a smaller 8 Series\. The bulbous headlamps of the 2 Series Gran Tourer are chiselled while the grille design is akin to the one seen on the 3 Series\. The front bumper design varies according to trim levels and matches the overall profile of the car\.

The silhouette has a flowing roofline ending up in a well\-sculpted boot lid\. The taillamp design appears to be borrowed from the 8 Gran Coupe and looks quite attractive for a small compact sedan\. Rounding off the exterior are dual exhaust setup, frameless doors and 18\-inch dual tone alloy wheels\. In terms of dimensions, the 2 Series Gran Coupe measures 4,526x1,800x1,420mm with a wheelbase of 2,670mm and a boot space of 430 litres\.

The 220d comes loaded with many bells and whistles you could expect from a luxury carmaker\. It gets powered front seats, digital instrument cluster, a 10\.25\-inch touchscreen infotainment system, gesture control, Apple CarPlay connected navigation, a panoramic sunroof, ambient lighting, etc\. Yes, you do miss a heads\-up display and ventilated seats\. Nonetheless, the M\-Sport allures you with its M\-specific tweaks with M Sport steering wheel and sporty aluminium pedals\. It also boasts of an M Sport body kit with sculpted bumpers and side aprons, 'M' badges on the front fenders, a shiny chrome grille, and glossy black trim around the windows\. Then, there are driver assists like active cruise control, lane change warning, rear collision warning, cross\-traffic warning, et al\. Additionally, the innovative reversing assistant and park assist are also offered here\.

- __Good Things__
	- Typical BMW driving dynamics
	- Handsome looks, especially in the M Sport trim
	- Feature\-loaded cabin
- __Could be Better__
	- Not exactly an affordable BMW
	- Strictly a four\-seater
	- Low ground clearance and ingress height

### 2 Series Gran Coupe Verdict

[BMW](https://www.carwale.com/bmw-cars/) 2 Series looks like an appealing package if you want a premium badge on a small\-sized car\. Its low\-slung stance, with handsome proportions, and striking elements make it look like a scaled\-down [8 Series](https://www.carwale.com/bmw-cars/8-series/) \- and that’s a good thing\. Even the cabin offers everything you’d expect from a Bavarian product\. And finally, the explosive performance from the 2\.0\-litre diesel will assuredly bring a wide grin on your face every time you decide to take the wheel\.
