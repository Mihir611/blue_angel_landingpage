This car now comes with three engine variants now which drives all the 4 wheels of the car\. Audi did keep the old 248Hp Turbocharged 4cyl engine and also have brought the 3\.0L V6 which increases the Horse power to 335Hp\. Out of the two engine variants offered the 248Hp Turbocharged version is the most preferred choice for fuel\-efficiency\.  
  
__Now coming to the Interior:__

The car has a seating capacity of 7 members so even families can feel comfortable and relaxing in the car\. With foldable rear seats, you can even increase the boot space of about 775 litres to even more\. This makes the Audi Q7 the perfect car for long drives and family tours\. Once you get past the massive luggage space available, you come into the interior of the car\. This is perhaps the best part of the car\. It is spacious and luxurious, fitted with all of the best techs you can think of in today's day and age\. You get a leather front seat that can be heated and comes with power lumbar adjustment as well as natural wood trims, which is only the start of it\.

The second row has a very conventional yet comfortable 35/30/35 split\. You can recline each seat, and there is also a cold\-weather package you can find that has heated back seats as well\. With a high headroom and 39 inches of legroom, it is quite spacious and convenient for 2 people\. However, a third one should only be added, if absolutely necessary\.

That said, the third\-row power split\-folding seats have a different story to tell altogether\. Even though the legroom is a bit narrow at only 29\.2 inches, there is a 50/50 split third seat with a power fold\. 

The factor that sets this car apart form its rivals is the technology put to this car by the engineers in Audi\. The dash of this cars is just absolutely magnificent\. You get 2 digital screens with various views; the digital speedometer can change its views depending on which mode you are on and even it can shrink itself if the driver wants a much clearer view of the map\. The Audi Q7 aims at providing a comfortable and luxurious experience to the owner, and that is not completed without the latest and world\-class technology\. Along with cameras all around the car for better parking, this car gets a 12\.1\-inch touch screen infotainment system\. The multimedia system connects directly to your phone, allowing you to answer or decline calls and also play songs right from the dash\. In addition to that, it also gets steering wheel controls, making it even more convenient and reducing distractions for the driver\.

__Storage:__

Talking about the boot the Audi Q7 is a pretty large car which means that it will have a huge storage\. However, with 7 passengers in the car the boot capacity is pretty small with just 295L of boot space but, with the 3rd row folded you will get a whopping 775L of Boot space which is a WOW factor and with both the middle and the 3rd row folded you will get 1,995 L of space which is Amazing for an SUV\.

The 3 Pros of the Q7

- The strong engine makes the drive smooth
- This car Handles well of twisty roads with very less body lean which is impressive\.
- Luxurious Interior

However, not everything is good about the car for instance:

- The big Size of the car makes it difficult to park\.
- Fluid Leaks\.
- Slightly unsettled ride on poor roads\.

__The Final Verdict:__

 If you are looking for a luxurious and comfortable experience, the Audi Q7 will win your heart\. However, if you want that punch when you accelerate and sometimes want to take your car off\-road, the BMW X5 is a better choice\. However, for the highest model, you will have to pay more when it comes to the BMW X5\.
